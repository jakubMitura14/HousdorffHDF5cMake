# CUDA accelerated Hausdorff Distance

Goal of this package is to improve the performance of the algorithm proposed by Rodrigues E. [1] in order to reduce execution timeof Hausdorff Distance calculation and implement average Hausdorff Distance for medical imagiing data.

Preliminary results show that current implementation is 10 times faster than this developed in [1] in order to conduct futher tests author is currently in process of integrating this repository with python pytorch.
